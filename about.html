<h4> Our Story </h4>
<p>
 African Clothing Unlimited was established in Africa by the famous   Wesseh's family in Liberia, West Africa. African Clothing Unlimited began to rise when the family decided to appoint a new Manager for Operation Mr. Jah S. Wesseh. The newly appointed manager took the organization to a higher level and began to invest more in it. Recently, he decided that the company started shipping  goods and services worldwide. This was successful and now the company is well known around the world for its magnificent business approach and customer services. 
 </p>
 <h4> Our Mission </h4>
 <p>This company was established as a means to help explore the beauty of  Africa through Clothing and fashions. It was first launched in 2005 but it began as a local business that only supplies goods to its neighbouring African countries.</p> 
 <h4> Our Vision </h4>
 <p> African clothing has branches in two countries, to be precise Liberia and the United States. Our goal is to make sure our customers are well satisfied and help ensure a better environment for our staff and customers.</p>
